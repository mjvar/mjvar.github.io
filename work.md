## Visualization Competencies
##### Matthew Varona, Maryam Hedayati, Matthew Kay, Carolina Nobre
Visualization literacy research lacks a theoretical foundation for what its component abilities actually are. To address this, we propose a model of visualization competencies that maps out the skills and knowledge needed to engage with visualizations. Our model organizes competencies around stages in the visualization process and highlights the interplay between reading and writing abilities. We developed the model by consulting a variety of sources, including reserach papers, college syllabi, K-12 curricula, instructional books, and interviews with professionals—which also allows us to reflect on diverging perspectives on literacy in visualization research, education, and practice. (To be submitted!)

## The State of the Art in Visualization Literacy
##### Matthew Varona, Karen Bonilla, Maryam Hedayati, Alark Joshi, Matthew Kay, Lane Harrison, Carolina Nobre
We reviewed 374 papers for a comprehensive overview of visualization literacy research. We learned a lot of interesting things, especially that visualization literacy is a rather fuzzy concept. As a step towards fixing that, we try to help researchers *operationalize*—that is, break down an abstract concept into researchable parts—by proposing a taxonomy of visualization literacy made of 5 categories of research and 4 competency themes. (Currently undergoing revision—preprint soon!)
