# cool stuff!
Here are some links to things I enjoy that you might want to check out:

### play
- my favorite daily word puzzles: **[RADDLE](https://raddle.quest/)** and **[Bracket City](https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/)**
- **[Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/today)** for quick & quirky crosswords, plus many other cool puzzles! wordbind and pile-up poker are pretty good
- **[PokéRogue](https://pokerogue.net/)** is pokémon reimagined as a roguelike, which is exactly as addictive as it sounds
- **[Music League](https://musicleague.com/)** is a thing where you can make a league with your friends, submit songs every week based on prompts, and then vote on your favorite songs! great way to keep in touch with people & obviously discover a ton of good music


### read
- **[Perfectly Imperfect](https://www.pi.fyi/read)**—tastes of taste from interesting people (guests include Charli xcx, Francis Ford Coppola, and The Rizzler)
- **[Queering the Map](https://www.queeringthemap.com/)**—a digital archive of queer experiences around the world
- **[against cop shit](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit.html)**—a provocation on the oft-adversarial relationship between students and educators
- **[I Am A Transwoman. I Am In The Closet. I Am Not Coming Out.](https://medium.com/@jencoates/i-am-a-transwoman-i-am-in-the-closet-i-am-not-coming-out-4c2dd1907e42)**—really personal essay about the trans experience
- **[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)**—visual, interactive essays about culture
- **[Wealth shown to scale](https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/)**—a visceral visualization of wealth inequality
- **[Taylor Swift and Totalitarianism](https://bluelabyrinths.com/2024/04/14/taylor-swift-and-totalitarianism/?fbclid=IwY2xjawLBDENleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHsB6lpEzpaCnf47pmVtTtuwCt4XI3ZgfdKnwlPZfoKrAJGeHojMsxZQUGx6Z_aem_iuga5S4JU62JTni8vCLALA)**— astute application of crit theory to a modern cultural behemoth (nothing against swifties tho)

### use
- **[LiquidText](https://www.liquidtext.net/)** is my favorite way to read academic papers
- **[Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/)** is an open-source video synth. if you've ever heard of modular synthesis, it's a similar idea—you can chain, patch, and manipulate video signals to produce wacky visuals. the landing page of this site was built with Hydra! (wrapped in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/))
- **[Tidalcycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)** is an open-source live coding environment for music. it's great for algorithmic and emergent sequencing (and it can hook up to Hydra for reactive visuals alongside your music!)
