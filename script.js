					Sonar DJ is an interactive electronic music installation made with Java, Processing, and Arduino. A sonar sensor constantly scans a mat in front of it. By placing different objects on the mat and moving them around, the user can trigger different sound loops and jam along to them live. The project also features audio visualizations using the Processing sound library.<br><br>This project was borned out of a desire I had to explore different tactile ways to make electronic music. I wanted to create something that felt responsive, and got people excited about making electronic music.

				<p>
					Bullet Time is a fast-paced bullet hell game where you can slow time. You pilot a ship (WASD/arrows) towards a portal, while dodging an onslaught of bullets from enemies. You can also use Slow (SPACE) to more precisely control your ship. This consumes a limited Slow Meter that slows both the bullets and your ship, allowing you to perfectly time and execute tight maneuvers. If you hold the button for too long, though, your Slow Meter depletes, which fast forwards the game back to normal speed. <br><br> I've always been fascinated by hard games, even though I'm not very good at them. What entices me about them is the feeling of invincibility one gets after failing a level over and over, and then succeeding in the end. In Bullet Time, I strove to make the game feel difficult but also satisfying.
