# about me!
I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Toronto working on **information visualization** and **human-computer interaction**. I am supervised by [Carolina Nobre](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cnobre/) as part of the Human Interaction Visualization (HIVE) Lab and the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://dgp.toronto.edu). Before U of T, I did my undergrad in computer science and interactive media at NYU Abu Dhabi. Before all of that, I grew up in Quezon City, Philippines.

I'm always down to chat about shared interests or collaborations. Feel free to email me at varona[at]cs.toronto.edu! 

# research interests
Broadly, I am interested in **how people make sense of the world through data and visualizations**. Specifically, I use the lens of visualization literacy to study the factors that shape peoples' encounters with data—both on an individual level (e.g. competence with visualizations) and a structural level (e.g. how data is produced and shared). My current projects involve mapping the abilities that make up visualization literacy, designing educational games about election data, and developing new ways to communicate about climate change based on subjective experience.

# etc.
My other interests include birdwatching, sewing, puzzles, urbanism, labor organizing, indie video games (especially roguelikes), music (see my most recently played track below), and vegan cooking.
