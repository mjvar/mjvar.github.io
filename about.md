# about me!
Hi, I'm Matthew! I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Toronto and the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://dgp.toronto.edu), working on **information visualization** and **human-computer interaction**. I am supervised by the amazing [Carolina Nobre](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cnobre/)! 

Broadly, I am interested in studying how people use data in their daily lives. Specifically, I use the lens of *visualization literacy* to define, measure, and improve the competencies that mediate access to data. Along the way, I try to critically analyze the definitions and concepts we come up with as a research community in terms of what values they promote and who might be excluded as a result. 

Prior to U of T, I did my undergrad in computer science and interactive media at NYU Abu Dhabi. I was also lucky to work with [Enrico Bertini](https://enrico.bertini.io) on visualization for machine learning interpretability and [Patrick Baudisch](https://hpi.de/baudisch/home.html) on adaptive interfaces for laser cutting. Before all that, I grew up in the Philippines.

My other interests include birdwatching, sewing, puzzles, labor organizing, indie video games (especially roguelikes), music (especially hyperpop), and vegan cooking. 

You are more than welcome to: email me at varona@cs.toronto.edu, read my [blog](/blog), or check out my [list of cool stuff on the Internet](/cool)!
